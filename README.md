# Hand_detection
    This is an object detection model,where i worked with my organization mates.
    
 # Problem description
 
    The shutter machine in an Tea production industry seeking a problem by "whenever you pass garbage by hand to a sutter machine".
    
    It rarely sometimes workers hand accidently will go more than limit,at that time some damage will occur for our worker".

# Use case:

     In this case we should use object detection model to train our machine with various kind of hand images.

     If sometimes you accidently put hand on garbage little bit more than limit into machine.My machine will automatically detect hand and stop a machine.
     
     I worked on ssd with moblienet model here pretrained weights :https://drive.google.com/file/d/1txQZBQCZpf-ziBhTCIv5qlugTMHfAdcO/view?usp=sharing
     
# Steps:
 
     * To download pretrained weights here : https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1CeghfTiyh9U7kfSQcBdZMGHjepRzLYoh?usp=sharing
     
     * Just command > pip install -r requirements.txt.
     
     * Then execute hand_detection.py.
